Fitted with huge air tanks and aircasters, it was the first pod in the competition to demonstrate pneumatic levitation, as in the original Hyperloop whitepaper.

Shock absorbers and eddy current brakes allowed us to run at higher speeds and propel ourselves under our own power. The fiberglass shell was our first venture into composites, with a smoothly curved design shaped by nylon stretched over wood.'

A new software system provided redundant control mechanisms across the pod. @Jimmy I actually completely forget what was on this pod halp'
